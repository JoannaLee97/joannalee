                <h3>WESTON ESTATE - 'COOL GIRL'</h3>
                <p class="news-summary">"COOL GIRL" serves as the inaugural follow-up to Weston Estate's summer EP, SUPERBLOOM, having been crafted during a dedicated songwriting session in Oak Land, North Carolina. The composition is characterized by its fluctuating atmosphere, transitioning between delicate vocals and powerful, full-bodied instrumental peaks that highlight the band's creative progression.
